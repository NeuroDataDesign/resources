# Pull requests
 - You should follow all of the contribution guidelines for whatever package you are PRing into. For example, [here](https://graspy.neurodata.io/contributing.html) are the guidelines for GraSPy. This includes giving the PR a descriptive title and filling out all of the boxes in the PR description.
 - You should make sure that you are only making the changes that you described in your PR. Always check the `Files changed` tab to see if you have made any unnecessary additions.
 - Make sure that you start with a clean version of whatever branch you want to merge into. Many of you incorporated changes that other people made to `master` in the NDD fork of your package. Then when you made your PR, the PR reflected many changes that were not listed as something you were trying to change. 
 - Make sure that tests and other checks (Travis) pass, this may take ~20-30 minutes after submitting your PR.
 - Don't make a PR into a real package (e.g. mainline Graspy, Sporf, Sklearn, etc.) unless you do all of the above.
