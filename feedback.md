# Feedback on presentations
- every deliverable you completed this week should have a link or figure showing the results in some form 
- every deliverable for next week should have a concrete definition of done (DoD). This is how we will 
evaluate whether or not you did that thing so make sure we can evaluate it. We will be taking off points 
for deliverables without DoDs.
- When showing code, use a jupyter notebook, which has been run, and shows the resulting output. Always 
use nbviewer to render your notebooks, and the link you provide should be to nbviewer
- For summaries, use markdown or some other format that can be read directly from a github link. Not .docx
- Make sure all of the text on your slide is readable. Don't use colors so light they can't be read on a 
white background 
- "Implementation of algorithm x" means creating the code that actually executes that algorithm. It does not 
mean to run someone's code which executes that algorithm on a dataset. 
- While we encourage everyone to learn Python, this is not a deliverable, and doesn't need to be reported in 
your presentations.
