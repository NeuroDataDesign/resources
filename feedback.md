# Feedback on presentations


This is how we will be evaluating you every week. As we add feedback to this list every week, please keep these comments in mind as they will affect your grading for the following week.

---

- every deliverable you completed this week should have a link or figure showing the results in some form 
- every deliverable for next week should have a concrete definition of done (DoD). This is how we will 
evaluate whether or not you did that thing so make sure we can evaluate it. We will be taking off points 
for deliverables without DoDs.
- When showing code, use a jupyter notebook, which has been run, and shows the resulting output. Always 
use nbviewer to render your notebooks, and the link you provide should be to nbviewer
- For summaries, use markdown or some other format that can be read directly from a github link. Not .docx
- Make sure all of the text on your slide is readable. Don't use colors so light they can't be read on a 
white background 
- "Implementation of algorithm x" means creating the code that actually executes that algorithm. It does not 
mean to run someone's code which executes that algorithm on a dataset. 
- While we encourage everyone to learn Python, this is not a deliverable, and doesn't need to be reported in 
your presentations. 
- Do not display any screenshots or figures which cannot be read by everyone. 
- If a screenshot is not something you want to get feedback on from the TAs or the class, and is just evidence, 
please just provide a link to the screenshot rather than showing it on your slide. 
- Extensive error logging messages are unnecessary, if anything, just show the most specific error message you
can 
- Make sure your presentation slides convey everything you need to get across during your presentation. We should 
not have to open your jupyter notebook or other content and display it to the class in order for everyone to understand. 
This means that the experiment/task you aimed to achieve, and the actual results, should be clear from the slides
themselves. The link to your evidence is to provide the TAs a way to tell what you actually did and to provide 
extra info to people who are interested. 
- Make sure your slides are up to date at the start of class, we should not have to refresh the slides constantly
